# Tina and Paul 2020
This project is a rewrite of [Tina and my wedding website](https://tinaandpaul.com), originally created in the Spring of 2002. HL Menken once said
> Every reporter has a novel in him, and that's where it belongs

Back in the days when this site was first created, I liked to paraphase:

> Every back-end developer has a website in them, and that's where it belongs

Which was my way of excusing the obvious limitations on my ability as a web designer, limitations that are plainly visible in the archive section of the site. Now, 18 years later, I'm able to lean on bootstrap to give me a design which, while it may lack inspiration, is certainly much cleaner that the 2002 edition. I'm also using React to provide a better UX.
